Background
-----------
For this project we are given 4 puzzles regarding knights and knaves. We know that a Knight always tells the truth and a Knave always lies. So using propositional logic, for each puzzle we encode two different types of information:

1 - information about the structure of the problem itself, meaning that you can only be either a Knight or a Knave and not both, and if you are a Knight then you are not a Knave and vice-versa

2 - information about what the individuals in the problem said.
  
Below is the solution obtained for puzzle 0 when you run the code, where puzzle 0 is: 
                      A says: "I am both a knight and a knave."
```
$ python puzzle.py
Puzzle 0
    A is a Knave
```
