To run the program:
```
$ python shopping.py shopping.csv
```
The output provided will be a True positive rate percentage and True negative rate percentage. True positive rate represents sensitivity
and this is the proportion of positive examples that were correctly identified, and in this case it is the portion of users who did end up completing a purchase 
that were correctly identified. True negative rate represents specificity, and this is the proportion of negative examples that were correctly identified, and in
this case it is the portion of users that did not end up completing a purchase that were correctly identified.
