# Traffic

**Description:** By implementing a neural network model using TensorFlow, the AI is able to predict with great accuracy which traffic signs appear in a photograph.

To run:
```
$ python traffic.py gtsrb
```



**NOTE:** For now I am unable to upload the gtsrb file as it contains alot of .ppm extension files, so when you want to run the code, please take the gtsrb file from the project page and just add it to the *traffic* directory.
